  <h2>What's the difference in code?</h2>
  <p>Basically, nothing. There is exactly one line difference between these two examples; only how the custom Service is loaded.</p>
  <pre>
    <span style="color:red;">-   &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/services/echoService.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    <span style="color:green;">+   &lt;script&gt;</span>
    <span style="color:green;">+     registerThreadsafeService(&#x27;echo&#x27;, &#x27;/scripts/services/echoService.js&#x27;);</span>
    <span style="color:green;">+   &lt;/script&gt;</span>
  </pre>
  <h2>What's the difference then?</h2>
  <p>The demo on the right loads the service in the context of a WebWorker and the Servorkers Library manages all coordination between the workers.</p>
  <h4>About this demo</h4>
  <p>The animated bars represent simulated main-thread work. Perhaps this is animation, touch handling, or DOM manipulation. Clicking the "Simulate..." button makes a call to a mock Angular service which simulates a block of code that takes a long time to complete. Imagine this is crunching through a data set or waiting on a synchronous network call.</p>
  <p>Both service models use <strong>the same service and the same service-consuming code</strong> (they are literally the same ng-view template). The "Normal" service-mode simply injects the service in the caller's normal context (e.g. a &lt;script&gt; tag). The "Service in Worker" (Servorker) mode provides a proxy instead and the service itself is loaded into a completely distinct angular application context living on another thread (a Worker).
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose a service type to test</li>
    <li>enter a string to be echoed back by simulated service</li>
    <li>click Simulate...</li>
    <li>observe impact on animation</li>
  </ol>
